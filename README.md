Tribble Protocol (v1.2.7-L)A High-Fidelity Balanced Ternary Communication StandardThe Tribble Protocol is a resilient, model-agnostic communication system designed to transmit data across Natural Language (NLP) channels where traditional binary data or escape characters are often stripped or misinterpreted. By using Balanced Ternary logic and a Rolling Carrier Wave, Tribble ensures that even the most "sanitized" chat environments can maintain a 100% data-integrity link.🚀 Quick StartInstallationEnsure you have Python 3.x installed.Bashchmod +x gemtrc.py

🛠 The Protocol Logic1. The Physical LayerData is represented by three states, mapping to any "Dialect" (LEDs, Arrows, or Digits):Positive (+1): 🔴 | > | 1Zero (0): ⚫ | = | 0Negative (-1): 🟢 | < | 22. Synchronization (The Preamble)Every transmission begins with a 5-Trit Preamble: +++++ (🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴). This signals the start of the framing window. Note that if the first character's modulated signal begins with a +, it may visually appear as a 6th red dot, but the decoder handles this via strict 5-trit clipping.3. Framing & Carrier WaveTo prevent "Signal Flatlining" (long runs of zeros) and to ensure phase alignment:Frame Size: 8 Trits (== [4-trit core] ==)Carrier Wave: A repeating + = - = pattern.Phase Reset: The carrier resets to index 0 at the start of every 8-trit block.Mixing Formula: $Signal = (Data + Carrier + 1) \pmod 3 - 1$📊 Character Mapping (v1.2.7-L)RangeMappingIndicesSpace     0UppercaseA-Z1 to 26Lowercasea-z-1 to -26Digits0-927 to 36Punctuation.,?!37 to 40Ext.

If a trit is corrupted during transit, the script suggests the nearest logical character.Verification (--verify): Performs a real-time round-trip integrity check (Re-decode of encoded output) to ensure no data was lost in the logic gate.Visual Audit (-v): Provides a step-by-step breakdown of how every LED was modulated and de-modulated.📜 LicenseThis protocol is released under the I42-Standard open-source framework. Designed for the Flotilla.
